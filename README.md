## Description
Jazz Robot is a resource for learning to play songs in all 12 keys. It assumes an ability to read chord changes, and a desire to understand chord functionality. One intended use case is to set an ipad or laptop on your piano/music stand and practice playing along with a metronome. I think jumping back and forth between literal chords and roman numeral (functional analysis) notation is an effective way to ease the learning curve of thinking about chords by their function.

## Future
+ I'd like to add interactivity and gamification to give structure and direction to practice sessions.
+ I'd like to add basic jazz harmony tutorials to aide musicians who aren't yet ready for the current (somewhat advanced) use case.
